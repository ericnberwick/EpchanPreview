                                I’ve been a very happy investor with QTS. They’ve provided consistent communications and
                                the team always makes themselves available for any questions I’ve had. Being able to
                                access high quality manager strategies within the QTS multi strategy approach is a great
                                diversified solution for me – it would be difficult to achieve the same level of
                                diversification on my own. The strategies have also provided excellent “crisis alpha”,
                                as exemplified in 2022 and early 2020. As a result of my experience, I’ve been adding
                                additional capital to QTS.

                                Having invested with QTS Capital Management’s founder Dr. Ernest Chan for over ten
                                years, I can attest that he is a portfolio manager of the highest integrity. Allocators
                                can take comfort that they will find professionalism and knowledge at the core of the
                                QTS methodology. Being a popular quantitative author and spokesperson has not isolated
                                Ernie; he is a down to earth associate of unerring good humor. The QTS Capital
                                Management foundation of excellence, created by Ernie, is now carried forward and
                                refined by CEO Dr. Nahid Jetha. Ernie and Nahid are at the cutting edge of innovative
                                portfolio management. As a team they seamlessly provide an investor with the systems and
                                security needed for success.

                                As a retired individual investor with QTS for over three years, I have been very pleased
                                with the steady performance. I wanted an all- weather portfolio that could perform
                                decently well even in adverse equity climates and offer some healthy diversification to
                                my overall portfolio, and QTS has delivered well on these objectives. The strategy has
                                virtually zero correlation to the S&amp;P 500, and actually has some convexity in
                                helping to hedge the broader equity markets in severe downturns, mainly due to the QTS
                                Tail Risk strategy. I appreciate that the small management team has worked together well
                                for many years, is quite responsive to investor's questions, and is continually looking
                                for ways to improve results. The multi-strategy approach now comprises ten strategies
                                (as of May 2024) so it is quite diversified as a multi strategy and has achieved a
                                superb three-year return -to- risk (eg. Sortino) ratio. I plan to stay as an investor
                                for at least ten more years and expect this to be one of the best performing, steadiest
                                "alternative" components of my retirement portfolio, and one which should give me
                                helpful hedging with positive returns even during equity bear markets.

                                QTS has delivered the portfolio diversification I was looking for when I first invested
                                with them. From my first interaction with Dr. Chan and Dr. Jetha, it was evident that
                                QTS operates with professionalism, expertise, and a true commitment to client
                                satisfaction. The team has consistently gone above and beyond to ensure my needs are
                                met. I have full confidence in their leadership and vision for the firm. After years of
                                outstanding investment experiences with QTS I can wholeheartedly endorse their approach.
                                I look forward to our continued relationship for years to come. Any individual or
                                organization would be in extremely capable hands by working with QTS.
